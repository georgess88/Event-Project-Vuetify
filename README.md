to run the project make sure you installed Python and nodejs

click on "run client dev mode.bat" to run client side

click on "run server.bat" to run server side

in case the dev mode didn't work this is beacuse you need to install vue cli, in this case please try vuetify build mode:
open "vuetify build mode" directory and click on "run client build mode.bat"
